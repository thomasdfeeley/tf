## What can I do with these real estate terms?

Use it as a study guide for taking the real estate exam. You could read the entire list word for word, make [real estate flashcards](https://quizlet.com/274314330/real-estate-terms-and-definitions-flash-cards/), create your own quiz, or even copy the entire list yourself. I found that copying and recopying the terms and definitions was the best way to create my own real estate exam study guide.

## Do I need to know all 497 real estate terms to pass the real estate salesperson exam?

No. For starters, a perfect score on the exam is not required to obtain a real estate license. So, you do not need to know them all to pass. However, studying these terms will improve your changes for both the state and national real estate exams.

## Will I need to know them in the field?

Yes. These terms will come up everywhere, from MLS property descriptions to interacting with real estate attorneys and developers. Top real estate agents know these terms and definitions, so start building your vocabulary.

From time to time, you will get asked questions from both clients and other people in the realty field that you weren't expecting.  Questions like:

- What is a CMA?
- What is a short sale?
- What does REO mean?
- What is blockbusting?
- What does cap rate mean?

And if you're caught flatfooted, you might have just lost some $$. Why not bookmark this page?  It's mobile friendly and easily accessible out on the road.  Duck into another room and quickly scan for the term below. Cause let's face it, you aren't going to carry around that salesperson study guide for the rest of your career.

## How much of this real estate exam study guide is just jargon?

A fair share. Don’t be intimidated. Separate yourself from less detail oriented salespersons and brokers by studying these realty terms. Once you are familiar with the lingo, it will become much easier to traverse.

## Are there terms or definitions that I can skip right over?

Probably just commission. We all know that means getting paid, right?

## I am a landlord/property manager, does any of this apply to me?

Maybe?  As a person responsible for the management of an income property, familiarizing yourself with some of the terms and definitions in the list below can only benefit the daily operation and profitability of the business. Create good customer service with a <a href="https://tomfeeley.com/maintenance-request-form/">maintenance request form</a>.

## I am already a Real Estate Agent, Salesperson, Broker, Realtor, etc., and I know the terms and definitions, why should I continue on?

Congratulations, this glossary of terms should just be a review to you.
