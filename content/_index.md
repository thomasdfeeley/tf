I help small businesses craft a better digital strategy, improve their UX, and get more search traffic from Google as [The Digital Squire](https://thedigitalsquire.com).

I've spoken at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/tom-feeley/17145) in San Francisco &amp; Boston on creating and maintaining a side hustle. Speaking of side hustles, I've been [studying real estate](https://tomfeeley.com/real-estate-terms/) trends of late.  I've been on the Developing Up podcast to talk about [continuous learning](http://www.developingup.com/27), and, I've turned a two buck chuck into halfway decent wine by [hyperdecanting](https://tomfeeley.com/hyperdecanting/) it.
